# Snake Self

This is an implementation of the classic Snake game using Pygame, with an AI-controlled snake that uses the A* pathfinding algorithm to navigate to the food.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Game Rules

- The snake automatically moves towards the food using the A* algorithm.
- The game ends if the snake collides with an obstacle or itself.
- Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer and new food appears.

## A* Algorithm Explanation

The A* (A-star) algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm used in this game to guide the snake to the food. Here's a simple explanation:

1. Start from the snake's head.
2. Look at all possible next moves (neighboring cells).
3. For each move, calculate two values:
   - G: the cost to move from the starting point to this square
   - H: the estimated cost to move from this square to the final destination (food)
4. Sum G and H to get F, the total estimated cost of the path through this square.
5. Choose the square with the lowest F value to move to next.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until reaching the food.

This allows the snake to find the shortest path to the food while avoiding obstacles.

## A* Algorithm Explanation

The A* (A-star) algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm used in this game to guide the snake to the food. Here's a simple explanation:

1. Start from the snake's head.
2. Look at all possible next moves (neighboring cells).
3. For each move, calculate two values:

4. Sum G and H to get F, the total estimated cost of the path through this square.
5. Choose the square with the lowest F value to move to next.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until reaching the food.

This allows the snake to find the shortest path to the food while avoiding obstacles.

How A* Helps?
A* helps in this game by:

Finding the optimal path: It ensures the snake takes the shortest route to the food.
Obstacle avoidance: It allows the snake to navigate around obstacles efficiently.
Efficiency: It's faster than exhaustive search algorithms, especially in larger grids.
Adaptability: It can quickly recalculate paths when new obstacles appear or when the food moves.

By using A*, the snake behaves more intelligently, creating a more challenging and interesting game experience.


## Alternatives to A*

1. Breadth-First Search (BFS): Simpler but less efficient for large grids.
2. Dijkstra's Algorithm: Good for finding the shortest path, but doesn't use heuristics like A*.
3. Greedy Best-First Search: Faster but may not always find the optimal path.

These alternatives could be used instead of A*, potentially changing the snake's behavior or performance. A* is often preferred as it balances efficiency and optimal path-finding.
